proj_description: We strengthen emerging Latin American leaders, equipping them with our CivicLab methodology. We have carried out over 11 editions of our School of Advocacy in countries like Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Perú, Chile, Brasil and México. Over 80 activists, public workers, journalists and academics have learned with us how to lead and articulate collective action to impact public policies.
